The following command will install the mimix program:-

	python setup.py install

This will need to be run by a user with write permissions to the Python
dist-packages directory. In most cases this will be root.  See the MANIFEST
file for a list of the files that will be installed.

PREREQUISITES
In order to run Mimix, you will need to install the following modules:
mod-python	http://modpython.org/
pycrypto	https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/
requests	http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/

On a Debian platform, these can be installed as follows:
apt-get install libapache2-mod-python
apt-get install python-crypto
apt-get install python-requests
