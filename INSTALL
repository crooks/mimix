The following command will install the mimix program:-

	python setup.py install

This will need to be run by a user with write permissions to the Python
dist-packages directory. In most cases this will be root.  See the MANIFEST
file for a list of the files that will be installed.

PREREQUISITES
In order to run Mimix, you will need to install the following modules:
mod-python	http://modpython.org/
pycrypto	https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/
requests	http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/

On a Debian platform, these can be installed as follows:
apt-get install libapache2-mod-python
apt-get install python-crypto
apt-get install python-requests


Once Mimix is installed, it needs to be run under a Unix system account.  Any
account can be used for client functionality but a dedicated account is
recommended for running Mimix as a server.

Before anything else, you need to build a directory of known remailers for
your client to reference.  The easiest way to do this is to import a directory
from one of the known remailers.  This can be done with the following command:

mimix update --fetch http://www.mixmin.net:8080

One option is to repeat this command for each known remailer but that can be
time-consuming and prone to error.  Another option is to append the '--walk'
option.  This will instruct the client to not only import the specified
remailer, but also to import all the remailers it knows about. E.g.:-

mimix update --fetch http://www.mixmin.net:8080 --walk

Your remailer client should now be ready to go.  You can run:-
mimix --help
for a list of available commands followed by:-
mimix command --help
for further details of the command options.

Also, check out the provided mimixrc.sample file which contains configuration
options that can be defined.  This file is compulsory if you intend to run
Mimix as a server.
