Mimix - A work-in-progress Mix-based Anonymous Remailer

The Mimix concept is to provide a Mixmaster-like protocol with support for
larger RSA keys (up to 4096 bits), replacement Hash (SHA2) and Symmetric
Ciphers (AES).  Instead of using SMTP for inter-Remailer traffic, Mimix uses
HTTP.  This makes it easy to blend in with the large traffic volume and
userbase of Tor (http://www.torproject.org).  Latency is still provided by
virtue of Dynamic Mix Pools at each Remailer node.
